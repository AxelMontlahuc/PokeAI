This branch allows you to control the mGBA GameBoy Advanced emulator through a C program. 

---
# Get Started
To get started, start mGBA and in ``Tools>Scripting``, load ``mGBASocketServer.lua``. 
Then, run ``mGBA-http-0.3.0-win-x64-self-contained.exe`` (you can run ``mGBA-http-0.3.0-win-x64.exe``if you have the right .NET version on your computer). 
Finally, compile ``controller.c`` through the ``compile.bat`` batch file.
